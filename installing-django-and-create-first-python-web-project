C:\wamp64\www\Python\pythonproject>

pythonproject/
    manage.py
    pythonproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        
        
 These files are:

    The outer pythonproject/ root directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; 
    you can rename it to anything you like.
    
    manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. 
    You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py.
    
    The inner pythonproject/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python 
    package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).
    
    pythonproject/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. 
    If you’re a Python beginner, read more about packages in the official Python docs.
    
    pythonproject/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about 
    how settings work.
    
    pythonproject/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. 
    You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.
    
    pythonproject/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI 
    for more details.
